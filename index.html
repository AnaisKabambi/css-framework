                 <p class="card-text">Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.
                     The Oxford Companion to Music describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory".
                     The first is the "rudiments", that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation);
                     the second is learning scholars' views on music from antiquity to the present;
                     the third is a sub-topic of musicology that "seeks to define processes and general principles in music".
                     The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis "in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built."[1]</p>

                <p class="card-text">An orchestra (/ˈɔːrkɪstrə/; Italian: [orˈkɛstra]) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music,
                    which combines instruments from different families, including:
                    bowed string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass;
                    woodwinds such as the flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon;

                     the timpani, xylophone, cymbals, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, tambourine, maracas, gongs, chimes, celesta, and piano.</p>

                     Today, they are made of wood, metal, plastic or some combination.
                     They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes, with holes, an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top.
                     You play them by blowing air through the mouthpiece (that's the "wind" in "woodwind") and opening or closing the holes with your fingers to change the pitch.
                     Metal caps called keys cover the holes of most woodwind instruments.</p>

                     This family of instruments can play louder than any other in the orchestra and can also be heard from far away.
                     Although their early ancestors are known to have been made of wood, tusks, animal horns or shells, today's modern instruments are made entirely of brass.
                     Brass instruments are essentially very long pipes that widen at their ends into a bell-like shape.
                     The pipes have been curved and twisted into different shapes to make them easier to hold and play.</p>
